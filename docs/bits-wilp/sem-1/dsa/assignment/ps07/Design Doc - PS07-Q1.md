## Design Analysis
1. The first thing that the program does is clear the output file `outputPS07Q1.txt`.
2. Then it reads the input data from the `inputPS07Q1.txt` file.
3. The custom implementation of the HashTable is an inner class called `CustomHashTable`.
4. This `CustomHashTable` has the following items:  
		a. An `ArrayList` to hold the items as chains. The items are stored in chains in these buckets to avoid collision.  
		b.asd  
		c. asd  
5. asd
